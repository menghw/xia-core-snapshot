xroute takes as input the name of the click element whose routing tables it
should modify and the name of an API configuration (assumed to be in 
./xsockconf.ini). If these arguments are not supplied, the defaults element
name is "router0" and no API configuration is set (the API defaults to 172.0.0.1).
