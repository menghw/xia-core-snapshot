Sample Xsocket applications

Ensure that . is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH by running the following shell command
or by adding it to your .profile
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.

Most of the samples display help when run with the -h command line parameter.

IMPORTANT: If you write your own programs that will run using the tools/xianet
configuration, you must add an entry to the xsockconf.ini configuration file to 
specify which network host the application will run on. If not configured, all
applications will use the 172.0.0.* network to communicate with click and will
end up running on the virtual Host0 host. As configured here, the server example
programs run on AD0:HID0 while the client applications run on AD1:HID1.
