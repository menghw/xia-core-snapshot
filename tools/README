Tools for building and runing XIA

for help on the scripts here, use the -h parameter on the command line

buildxia - build all the XIA components, can be run from anywhere in the XIA tree

xidgen - simple tool to create a unique 40 character XID

xroute - view/edit the XIA route tables. Route changes are not permanent and will be
reset the next time the network is restarted. Unless you know what you are doing,
avoid making changes!

xianet - start the XIA network components.

run_demo - start the XIA web demo processes.

xianet_click_output_only - start the xia services, but don't check to see if click is
already running. Should be used in conjunction with run_click in verbose mode to enable
debug messages to the console.

run_click - start the click process, but not the other XIA services. Can be used in
conjunction with xia_click_output_only script for debug purposes

run_bootstrap - older version of xianet, kept for historical purposes

create_redirect_routes - for test purposes
