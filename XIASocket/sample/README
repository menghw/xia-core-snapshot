video streaming on local browser (e.g., your laptop and no geni host)
for that, 

first on your client/laptop modify your .ssh/config in following way

Host emulab
 Hostname ops.emulab.net
 LocalForward 2222 pg56.emulab.net:22
 user ashokana

Host client
 Hostname localhost
 HostKeyAlias pg56.emulab.net
 port 2222
 ForwardX11 yes
 ForwardX11Trusted yes
 LocalForward 7500 pg56.emulab.net:8000


then, 

ssh username@emulab first
followed by, mberman@client

set your browser, to use localhost, 7500

then you can do streaming, or image loading..
