This folder contains examples of the client-server
An ini configuration file is needed for the library.
The library looks for the XSOCKCONF environment variable
to find the ini file, but defaults to the
default ini file: xsockconf.ini.

The .ini file contains IP fields which need to be defined before
compiling. These fields depend on the IP of the fake interface.
The client and the server require different IP settings in
Xsocket.h for the loopback test, and are hence in different
folders.

To run the loopback test:
1. sudo userlevel/click conf/xia_chain_topology_socket.click
2. sample/xs
3. sample/xc

To run a ping test
1. sudo userlevel/click conf/xia_chain_topology_socket.click
2. sample/ps 

You should see something like the message below when you run ps

dongsuh@gs7602:~/Documents/xia-core/XIASocket/sample$ ./ps
api_addr 172.0.0.1
click_controladdr 172.0.0.2
click_dataaddr 172.0.0.2

You should see something like..

Python API example:

sample/pingClient.py


libXsocket needs a configuration file. 
Default is xsockconf.ini but one can set a environment variable XSOCKCONF to change the file.
Under the file, you need to define address to use to talk to the host in click. 
Each section name (e.g., [ps] in xsockconf.ini) in the ini file should be the exe filename (in C/C++).
Or in the program you can specify the section to look by setting the environment variable 
Or you can set the configuration use set_conf(char *inifile, char *sectioname)
When using python you can  to use set_conf or the environment variable, XSOCKCONF_SECTION.
Examples ini files are xsockconf.ini and python/xsockconf_python.ini



TROUBLESHOOTING.
- You may see protobuf error when click and the API both got updated but you didn't re-compile one. 
You should recompile click-2.0, API and sample when they get updated.
