Simple chain topolgy running on four GENI hosts.

pg56 (host0) ----- pg55 (router0) ----- pg42 (router1) ----- pg40 (host1) 


Each script is to be run on different GENI host (according to their file names).
(Ex on machine pg56): sudo CLICKDIR/userlevel/click host0-pg56.click

You can test, for example, running ./ps on pg56 and ./pc on pg40.
