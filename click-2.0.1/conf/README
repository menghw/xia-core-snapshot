Emulation of a simple topology 
    xia_chain_topology_socket.click

IPv4 principal tester
    xia_ipv4.click

Stand-alone Ethernet XIA Router
	xia_two_port_router.click

Performance Testing was done using scripts in conf/xia. Some of the configuration uses RouterBricks' MQ*Device and some of them use Packet Shader's PS*Device.  Note that to use these elements you need to compile and install specific drivers and NIC hardware.

XIA Router with IP tunnels
	xia_chain_topology_server.click
	xia_chain_topology_client.click

These show UDPIPEncap of XIA packet for wide-area deployment. But the host uses old RCP module. This need to be changed to use XUDP.  Each script run a network with a single router and a host.  The two routers are connected via a IP-encapsulated tunnel (conceptually).
